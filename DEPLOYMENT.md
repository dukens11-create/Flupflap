# Deploying FlupFlap to Render

## ⚠️ Critical: Web Service — not Static Site

FlupFlap is a **server-rendered Next.js application**. It uses:
- Dynamic API routes (auth, Stripe, Prisma)
- NextAuth session handling
- Stripe webhooks
- Middleware / proxy for protected routes
- Prisma PostgreSQL ORM

This means it **must** run as a live Node.js process. It cannot be deployed as a static site.

**Common failure:** `Publish directory dist does not exist!`

This error does **not** mean the build is broken. The Next.js build (`next build`) always succeeds and produces a `.next/` directory. This error only appears when Render is configured as a **Static Site** looking for a `dist` folder that does not exist. The fix is to deploy as a **Web Service**.

---

## Option 1 — Blueprint (recommended)

This repo includes a `render.yaml` file that tells Render exactly how to deploy the app as a Web Service.

1. Push this repo to GitHub (or fork it).
2. Open [Render](https://render.com) and click **New → Blueprint**.
3. Connect your GitHub account and select this repository.
4. Render reads `render.yaml` and automatically creates a **Web Service** with the correct build and start commands.
5. Fill in the environment variables (see below).
6. Click **Apply** — Render will build and deploy.

---

## Option 2 — Manual service creation

If you do not want to use the Blueprint approach, create a new service manually.

### Step 1 — Choose the right service type

In the Render dashboard, click **New** and select **Web Service**.

> ❌ Do **not** choose Static Site.  
> ❌ Do **not** choose any option that asks for a publish directory.

### Step 2 — Connect your repository

Connect your GitHub account and select this repository.

### Step 3 — Configure the service

Set these values exactly:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Name** | `flupflap` (or any name you choose) |
| **Region** | Your preferred region |
| **Branch** | `main` |
| **Runtime** | Node |
| **Build Command** | `npm install && npm run build && if [ -n "$DATABASE_URL" ]; then npx prisma db push --skip-generate; fi` |
| **Start Command** | `npm run start` |
| **Publish Directory** | *(leave completely empty)* |

> **Why no publish directory?**  
> `next build` outputs a server bundle to `.next/`. The server is started with `next start`, which reads that directory automatically. There is no static `dist` folder — setting a publish directory will break the deployment.

### Step 4 — Add environment variables

In the **Environment** tab, add:

| Variable | How to get it |
|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string (e.g. from Render Postgres, Supabase, or Neon) |
| `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` | Click **Generate** next to this field in Render |
| `NEXTAUTH_URL` | The full public URL Render assigns you, e.g. `https://flupflap.onrender.com` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` | Same value as `NEXTAUTH_URL` |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | From your Stripe dashboard → Developers → API keys |
| `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | From your Stripe dashboard → Developers → API keys |
| `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | From Stripe → Webhooks → your endpoint → Signing secret |
| `PLATFORM_FEE_PERCENT` | Legacy bootstrap env var; the app normalizes seller commission to `7` |
| `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` | From your Cloudinary dashboard — Settings → API Keys |
| `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY` | From your Cloudinary dashboard — Settings → API Keys |
| `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET` | From your Cloudinary dashboard — Settings → API Keys |
| `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` | From your Twilio Console — Account SID |
| `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` | From your Twilio Console — Auth Token |
| `TWILIO_FROM_NUMBER` | Your Twilio phone number (e.g. `+15005550006`) |

### Step 5 — Deploy

Click **Create Web Service**. Render will:
1. Clone the repository
2. Install npm dependencies
3. Run `prisma generate && next build`
4. Apply the Prisma schema with `prisma db push` (if `DATABASE_URL` is set at build time)
5. Start the server with `next start`

A successful deploy shows the app live at your Render URL.

---

## Cloudinary (image uploads)

Sellers upload product images directly from their device. Images are stored on
[Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com), which has a generous free tier and works
seamlessly with Render.

### Step 1 — Create a Cloudinary account

Sign up for free at <https://cloudinary.com>. No credit card required for the
free tier.

### Step 2 — Copy your credentials

Open the Cloudinary dashboard and go to **Settings → API Keys**. You need:

| Value | Environment variable |
|---|---|
| Cloud name | `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` |
| API key | `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY` |
| API secret | `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET` |

### Step 3 — Add the variables to Render

In your Render **Web Service → Environment**, add the three variables above.
Redeploy once to pick up the new values.

### How it works

When a seller picks a file on the **List Item** or **Edit Listing** page, the
browser posts it to `/api/upload`. That route verifies the seller session,
uploads the file to Cloudinary, and returns the hosted URL. The URL is placed
in the form's `imageUrl` field before the form is submitted, so the rest of the
product create/update flow is unchanged.

- Accepted formats: JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF (up to 10 MB)
- Images are stored under the `flupflap/products/` folder in your Cloudinary
  account
- Sellers can also paste a direct image URL if they prefer not to upload

> **Without Cloudinary configured** the file-picker upload returns a 503 error
> and sellers can still paste a URL directly — backward compatibility is
> preserved.

## Seller two-factor authentication (phone OTP)

When a seller signs in, FlupFlap sends a 6-digit one-time code to their
registered mobile number.  They must enter this code before the authenticated
session is granted.  The feature is **scoped to SELLER accounts only** — buyers
and admins use the normal single-factor login.

### How it works

1. Seller enters their email and password on the login page.
2. The server validates the credentials and sends a 6-digit SMS code.
3. Seller enters the code on the second step of the login page.
4. The server verifies the code (10-minute expiry, 5-attempt limit, 60-second
   resend cooldown) and grants the session.

### Step 1 — Create a Twilio account

Sign up for free at <https://www.twilio.com>.  You will need:

- A **verified phone number** (Twilio trial) or a purchased number.
- The **Account SID** and **Auth Token** from the
  [Twilio Console](https://console.twilio.com).

### Step 2 — Get a Twilio phone number

In the Twilio Console go to **Phone Numbers → Manage → Buy a number** (or use
your trial number for testing).  Copy the number in E.164 format, e.g.
`+15005550006`.

### Step 3 — Add the variables to Render

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` | `ACxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx` |
| `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` | your auth token |
| `TWILIO_FROM_NUMBER` | your Twilio number in E.164 format, e.g. `+15005550006` |

Redeploy once after adding the variables.

### Dev / mock mode (no Twilio)

If any of the three Twilio variables are absent, the app runs in **mock mode**:
the OTP is logged to the server console (`[OTP DEV MODE]`) instead of being
sent by SMS.  This lets you develop and test locally without a Twilio account.

> **Important:** when `NODE_ENV=production` (which Render sets automatically),
> the app will throw a startup error if any `TWILIO_*` variable is missing,
> preventing sellers from bypassing the second factor.  Always set all three
> `TWILIO_*` variables in the Render environment before going live.

### SMS OTP rollout / temporary disable switch

Twilio-based seller OTP is now the default login behavior.  You can still
temporarily allow sellers to sign in with email + password only by setting:

```
ENABLE_SMS_OTP=false
```

This bypasses the SMS challenge entirely so sellers are not locked out during a
provider outage.  The entire OTP code path remains in the codebase — no code
changes are needed to re-enable it.

**To keep or restore Twilio-backed SMS OTP:**

1. In your Render dashboard (or hosting environment), leave `ENABLE_SMS_OTP`
   unset or set it to `"true"`.
2. Redeploy the app (or restart the process so the new env var takes effect).
3. Sellers will be prompted for an SMS code on their next login.

> If `ENABLE_SMS_OTP` is unset it defaults to **enabled**. Set it explicitly to
> `false` only when you need the temporary bypass. Quoted values like `"false"`
> are also supported.

### Testing seller sign-in locally

1. Create a seller account (`role: SELLER`) via the signup page.  Supply any
   phone number.
2. Sign in with the seller's email and password.
3. Watch the server console for the line:

   ```
   [OTP DEV MODE] To: +15005550006  Message: Your FlupFlap verification code is: 123456. …
   ```

4. Enter that 6-digit code on the verification screen to complete sign-in.

> When `ENABLE_SMS_OTP=false`, steps 3–4 are skipped and the seller is signed
> in immediately after entering their email and password.  In the default
> enabled state, local development still works because the OTP is logged to the
> server console when Twilio credentials are absent.

## Seller dashboard — earnings and balance

Sellers have a dedicated dashboard at `/seller` that shows:

- **Earnings Summary** — aggregated stats from all completed orders:
  - Items sold (total quantity across paid/shipped/delivered orders)
  - Orders completed (count of distinct orders)
  - Gross sales (sum of item prices before commission)
  - Platform fees deducted (using stored commission snapshots)
  - Net earnings (gross minus commission)
- **Stripe Balance** (only shown when the seller has completed Stripe Connect
  onboarding):
  - Available balance — funds ready for payout
  - Pending balance — funds not yet settled (typically 2-7 business days)
  - A link to the seller's Stripe Express dashboard for full payout history
- **Sold Items table** — line-item list of every sold product with title, date,
  quantity, item price, commission fee, net payout, and order status.
- **Recent Orders** — full order view with a "Mark Shipped" action for orders
  in PAID status.

### Important notes

- Earnings figures are computed from your app's order/item data.  The Stripe
  balance reflects funds in the seller's connected Stripe account and may
  differ from calculated earnings if payouts have already been transferred to
  the seller's bank.
- If the Stripe balance API call fails (e.g. the connected account is not fully
  verified), the dashboard displays "Unavailable — check your Stripe dashboard"
  and falls back gracefully without an error page.
- Sellers without a Stripe Connect account see a prompt to connect and a note
  that balance data requires connection.

---

## Stripe webhook configuration

After deploying, register a webhook endpoint in the Stripe dashboard:

- **Endpoint URL:** `https://<your-render-url>/api/stripe/webhook`
- **Events to listen for:** `checkout.session.completed`, `account.updated`, `customer.subscription.updated`, `customer.subscription.deleted`, `invoice.payment_succeeded`, `invoice.payment_failed`

Copy the **Signing secret** and set it as `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in Render.

---

## Database

This app requires a PostgreSQL database. Options:
- [Render PostgreSQL](https://render.com/docs/databases) — easiest if you are already on Render
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com) — generous free tier
- [Neon](https://neon.tech) — serverless Postgres with a free tier

After creating the database, copy the connection string into the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.

### Automatic schema setup (Blueprint / render.yaml)

When `DATABASE_URL` is set in the Render environment before the deploy runs, the build
command automatically applies the Prisma schema:

```bash
npm install && npm run build && \
  if [ -n "$DATABASE_URL" ]; then npx prisma db push --skip-generate; fi
```

`prisma db push` is safe for additive schema sync and will stop if Prisma detects
potentially destructive changes. Do **not** force `--accept-data-loss` in production
deploy commands. If `DATABASE_URL` is not set at build time the `db push` step is skipped
automatically.

### Manual schema setup (first deploy without Blueprint, or DATABASE_URL added after build)

If you added `DATABASE_URL` after the first build already ran (so the automatic step was
skipped), run the schema push manually once:

```bash
npx prisma db push
```

You can do this from:
- A **Shell** / **Exec** tab inside your Render Web Service (if your plan provides one)
- Your local machine, with `DATABASE_URL` set to the **External Database URL** from Render

### Seed demo data (optional)

To populate the database with demo products and accounts:

```bash
npm run seed
```

Demo accounts created by seed:
- Admin: `admin@flupflap.com` / `password123`
- Seller: `seller@flupflap.com` / `password123`

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `Publish directory dist does not exist!` | Service is configured as Static Site | Delete the service and recreate it as a Web Service, or change the service type in Settings |
| `PrismaClientInitializationError` | `DATABASE_URL` is missing or wrong | Set `DATABASE_URL` in Render → Environment |
| Homepage shows "Database schema not yet initialized" | `DATABASE_URL` was added after the first build ran, so `prisma db push` was skipped | Trigger a new deploy (the build will now run `prisma db push` automatically), or run it manually |
| NextAuth errors / redirect loop | `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` or `NEXTAUTH_URL` missing | Set both env vars; `NEXTAUTH_URL` must match the public Render URL |
| Stripe webhook `400` errors | `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` missing or wrong | Re-copy the signing secret from Stripe and update the env var |
| App loads but images are broken | Image host not in `next.config.js` | Add the hostname to `remotePatterns` in `next.config.js` |
| Image upload returns "not configured" error | Cloudinary env vars missing | Add `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`, `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`, `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET` in Render → Environment and redeploy |
| Seller login returns `step: "signin"` from `/api/auth/otp/send` | OTP feature disabled or account is not a seller | Check server logs for `[otp/send] OTP skipped: ...`; set `ENABLE_SMS_OTP=true` (or unset) to require seller OTP |
| Seller login returns `step: "add_phone"` from `/api/auth/otp/send` | Seller account has no phone on file | Complete `/api/auth/otp/setup-phone`; logs show `[otp/send] Seller requires phone setup before OTP` |
| Seller OTP send returns 400 invalid phone | Saved seller phone fails normalization | Update seller phone in E.164 format; logs include `[otp/send] OTP blocked: invalid normalized phone` |
| Seller OTP code never arrives | Twilio env vars missing or wrong | Set `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, `TWILIO_FROM_NUMBER` in Render → Environment and redeploy |
| Seller OTP arrives in server logs only | App running in mock/dev mode | Set all three `TWILIO_*` env vars in Render → Environment so real SMS is sent |
| Seller OTP send fails with 500 | Twilio config/API failure | Review `[SMS] Twilio is not configured...`, `[SMS] Failed to send message`, or `[SMS] Message accepted by Twilio` log events |

## Admin seller moderation

Admins can suspend or permanently ban seller accounts from the admin panel at
`/admin/sellers`.

### How it works

1. Admin navigates to **Admin Dashboard → Seller Management** (or `/admin/sellers`).
2. Each seller card shows the current status (Active / Suspended / Banned) and
   listing count.
3. Expanding the **Moderation actions** section reveals a form to:
   - **Suspend** — temporary restriction while investigating.
   - **Ban** — permanent restriction.
   - **Reinstate** — lift a prior suspension or ban.
4. A reason category (required for suspend/ban) and optional internal notes are
   recorded with each action.
5. The action is written to the `SellerModerationLog` audit table, capturing who
   performed the action, when, the reason, and any notes.

### Reason categories

| Key | Label |
|---|---|
| `misconduct_to_customer` | Misconduct to customer |
| `fake_product` | Fake product |
| `unlawful_activity` | Unlawful activity |
| `fraud` | Fraud |
| `spam` | Spam |
| `policy_violation` | Policy violation |
| `other` | Other |

### What restrictions do for sellers

When a seller's status is **Suspended** or **Banned**:

- The seller dashboard shows a neutral restriction notice.
- The "New listing" button is hidden.
- Attempting to create or edit listings redirects to the seller dashboard.
- API routes for creating/editing/shipping listings return 403.
- The Stripe Connect payout link is blocked.

Restriction messaging to the seller is intentionally neutral:

> *"Your seller account has been restricted. If you believe this is an error,
> please contact support."*

### Audit trail

Every moderation action is stored in `SellerModerationLog` with:
- `sellerId` — the affected seller
- `adminId` — the admin who performed the action
- `action` — `SUSPENDED`, `BANNED`, or `REINSTATED`
- `reasonCategory` — one of the reason keys above
- `notes` — free-text internal notes (never shown to the seller)
- `createdAt` — timestamp

The last five log entries are shown in the seller card on `/admin/sellers`.

---

## Product reporting and moderation

Authenticated users can report product listings they believe are fake,
counterfeit, misleading, prohibited, fraudulent, or otherwise problematic.
Admins can review those reports and take moderation action on the listing
and/or the seller.

### User-facing reporting flow

1. Any signed-in user (who is **not** the seller of the listing) sees a
   **"Report item"** link at the bottom of the product detail page.
2. Clicking it opens an inline form where the user selects a reason and
   optionally provides details.
3. Report reasons:
   - Fake / counterfeit item
   - Misleading description
   - Misleading photos
   - Prohibited item
   - Scam / fraud
   - Item unavailable / deceptive availability
   - Other
4. Submitting a report calls `POST /api/products/[id]/report`.
5. Duplicate suppression: one open report per **reporter / product / reason**
   combination is enforced at the database level (`@@unique` constraint).
   If the same reporter re-submits an identical reason, the notes are updated
   rather than creating a second record.
6. Reporters are not identified to the seller. Admin notes are private.

### Admin moderation queue

The queue is at `/admin/reports` and is linked from the Admin Dashboard.
The dashboard nav highlights the Reports button in red when open reports exist.

Admins can filter by status: **Open** / **Dismissed** / **Resolved**.

For each open report, the admin sees:
- Report reason and reporter-supplied notes
- Product title, image, current status, and a link to view the listing
- Seller name, email, and current seller status
- Reporter name and email

Admins can take the following actions:

| Action | Effect |
|---|---|
| **Dismiss** | Marks report DISMISSED; no product/seller change |
| **Mark resolved** | Marks report RESOLVED; no additional change |
| **Hide / remove listing** | Sets `product.status = HIDDEN`; listing disappears from browse |
| **Warn seller** | Logs a WARNED entry in `SellerModerationLog`; no status change |
| **Suspend seller** | Sets `sellerStatus = SUSPENDED` + audit log |
| **Ban seller** | Sets `sellerStatus = BANNED` (permanent) + audit log |

All actions record the acting admin, timestamp, action taken, and any admin notes
in the report record. Seller-level actions also appear in `SellerModerationLog`.

### Product HIDDEN status

`HIDDEN` is a new `ProductStatus` value used when a listing is removed via
moderation. Hidden listings:
- Are not shown in the browse/search product grid (only `APPROVED` listings appear).
- Return a 404 on the product detail page, identical to rejected listings.
- Are distinguishable from `REJECTED` (rejected during initial review) in the
  admin database for audit purposes.

### Schema additions

- `ProductStatus` enum: added `HIDDEN` value.
- `ReportStatus` enum: `OPEN | DISMISSED | RESOLVED`.
- `ProductReport` model: stores product, seller (denormalized), reporter, reason,
  notes, status, admin resolution fields, and timestamps.
- `@@unique([reporterId, productId, reason])` enforces duplicate suppression.

### Limitations

- Evidence file attachments are not supported (text-based reporting only).
  Cloudinary upload could be added in a future iteration.
- Rate limiting beyond the per-reporter/product/reason uniqueness constraint is
  not implemented. A Redis-based rate limiter could be added if abuse is observed.
- Anonymous (unauthenticated) reporting is not supported; authentication is
  required to submit a report.

## Local pickup and buyer-to-seller distance

Sellers can mark individual listings as available for local pickup. Buyers can
see pickup availability, the seller's approximate location, and their distance
from the seller.

### How it works

#### For sellers
1. When creating or editing a listing, check **"This item is available for local pickup"**.
2. Enter a **city**, **state**, and **ZIP / postal code** for the pickup location.
   - Only city and state are shown publicly. The postal code is used only for
     approximate distance calculation and is never displayed to buyers.

#### For buyers
- The product listing card shows a **"🏠 Pickup in City, State"** badge if pickup is available.
- The product detail page shows a **green pickup widget** with:
  - The seller's city and state.
  - A **"Show distance from me"** button that uses the browser's Geolocation API
    (with the buyer's consent) to calculate the approximate distance in miles.
- At checkout, items with pickup available show a **"Pick up in City, State"** toggle.
  Choosing pickup removes the shipping fee for that item and does not collect a
  shipping address from Stripe.
- The product page also shows a **"🏠 Buy now — Pick up locally"** button that
  creates a pickup-only Stripe checkout session (no shipping address, no shipping fee).

### Distance calculation

Distance is calculated with the Haversine formula using:
- **Buyer location**: browser Geolocation API (requires permission from the buyer).
- **Seller location**: the seller's postal code is geocoded via the free
  [zippopotam.us](https://api.zippopotam.us) service (no API key required).

This gives city-level accuracy. If the buyer denies location access or the
postal code cannot be geocoded, the distance widget shows a friendly error.

**Limitation**: distance is approximate (city-level, not street-level) and
requires the buyer to grant location permission in their browser. Exact pickup
addresses are never stored or displayed; sellers should exchange precise
address details with buyers privately after an order is placed.

### Pickup orders

- Pickup orders are stored with `isPickup = true` on the `Order` record.
- The order detail page shows a green **"Local Pickup Order"** banner with the
  seller's city and state, and a prompt to contact the seller to arrange a
  pickup time and confirm the exact location.
- Shipping tracking is not applicable for pickup orders.
- No shipping address is collected from Stripe for pure pickup orders.

### Schema changes

The following columns were added to support pickup:

| Table | Column | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Product` | `pickupAvailable` | `Boolean` | Whether pickup is offered |
| `Product` | `pickupCity` | `String?` | Seller pickup city |
| `Product` | `pickupState` | `String?` | Seller pickup state/region |
| `Product` | `pickupPostalCode` | `String?` | Used for distance geocoding (not shown to buyers) |
| `Order` | `isPickup` | `Boolean` | Whether this order is a pickup order |
| `Order` | `pickupCity` | `String?` | Pickup city snapshot on order |
| `Order` | `pickupState` | `String?` | Pickup state snapshot on order |

No new environment variables are required for the pickup feature.
The geocoding proxy (`/api/geo/zip`) calls `api.zippopotam.us` from the server;
no API key or account is needed.

---

## Pickup handoff confirmation

When a buyer places a pickup order, a **6-digit pickup confirmation code** is
automatically generated and stored with the order.

### How it works

1. After successful payment, the Stripe webhook creates the order and generates
   a random 6-digit pickup code (stored as `pickupCode` on the `Order` record).
2. The buyer can view their pickup code on the **Order Detail** page
   (`/orders/[id]`). It is displayed prominently so the buyer can show it to
   the seller at the handoff.
3. The seller opens the order in their **Seller Dashboard** (`/seller`) and
   enters the buyer's 6-digit code in the "Confirm Pickup" form.
4. If the code matches, the order status is updated to **PICKED\_UP** and the
   `pickupConfirmedAt` timestamp is recorded.
5. The order detail page then shows a confirmation message instead of the code.

### Order statuses for pickup flow

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `PAID` | Payment confirmed; pickup code generated and visible to buyer |
| `READY_FOR_PICKUP` | (Optional) Seller can manually mark when item is ready |
| `PICKED_UP` | Seller verified the buyer's code; handoff complete |

### Schema additions for pickup confirmation

| Table | Column | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Order` | `pickupCode` | `String?` | Plaintext 6-digit code shown to buyer |
| `Order` | `pickupConfirmedAt` | `DateTime?` | When the pickup was confirmed |
| `Order` | `pickupConfirmedById` | `String?` | Seller user ID who confirmed the pickup |

### Anti-fraud protections

- The pickup code is order-specific and single-use (matched by exact string).
- Only sellers who own an item in the order can verify the code.
- Restricted (suspended/banned) sellers cannot verify pickup codes.
- Pickup confirmation events can be reviewed by admins via the admin user
  detail page.

## Phone number management for existing accounts

Buyers and sellers who created accounts without a phone number can add or
update their phone number from the **Account Settings** page (`/account`).

### How it works

1. User navigates to `/account` and sees the **Phone number** section.
2. If no phone is set, a link "Add phone" appears. If a phone is set, an
   "Update" link is shown alongside the current number and its verification
   status.
3. User clicks Add/Update → enters their phone number → clicks **Send code**.
4. A 6-digit verification code is sent by SMS (or logged to the console in dev
   mode).
5. User enters the code → clicks **Verify**. The phone is saved and marked as
   verified.

### Seller login without a phone number (migration flow)

If a seller who does not yet have a phone number tries to sign in:

1. After entering correct credentials, the login page shows a **phone capture
   step** instead of the OTP step.
2. The seller enters their phone number and clicks **Send verification code**.
3. An OTP is sent to that phone. The phone number is saved (unverified) to the
   seller's account.
4. The seller enters the OTP to complete sign-in. On success, the phone is
   automatically marked as verified (`phoneVerified = true`).
5. All future sign-ins use the normal OTP flow.

This ensures existing sellers can migrate to the required 2FA phone setup
without being locked out of their accounts.

### Schema additions

| Table | Column | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `User` | `phoneVerified` | `Boolean` | Whether the phone has been verified via OTP |
| `User` | `phoneVerifiedAt` | `DateTime?` | When the phone was verified |
| `PhoneVerificationToken` | (new model) | — | Stores pending OTP for account phone updates |

The `PhoneVerificationToken` model uses the same security measures as
`SellerOtp`: bcrypt-hashed code (cost 8), 10-minute expiry, 5-attempt limit,
and 60-second resend cooldown.

### Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| Phone code never arrives | Check Twilio env vars; dev mode logs code to console |
| Seller login shows "Add phone" step | Normal for sellers without a phone — they complete the phone setup flow on first login |

---

## Admin user management and support access

Admins can view and manage buyer and seller accounts from the admin panel at
`/admin/users`.

### What admins can see

- **User list** (`/admin/users`): searchable/filterable list of all buyers and
  sellers with name, email, role, order count, and joined date.
- **User detail** (`/admin/users/[id]`): full account information including:
  - Profile details (name, email, role, phone, phone verification status)
  - Seller status and moderation state (for seller accounts)
  - Stripe Connect status (for seller accounts)
  - Recent orders (as buyer or as seller)
  - Listings with status (for seller accounts)
  - Moderation history (for seller accounts)

### What admins cannot see

- Password hashes (deliberately excluded from all admin queries)
- Raw authentication secrets or tokens
- Full payment card data (handled by Stripe, never stored)

### Granting admin access to an existing user

Use the `POST /api/admin/grant-admin` endpoint to promote an existing user to
the `ADMIN` role.  The caller must already be authenticated as an `ADMIN`.

**Request**

```http
POST /api/admin/grant-admin
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "phone": "+17753891414"
}
```

At least one of `email` or `phone` must be provided (both are accepted).
Phone numbers are normalized to E.164 automatically, so formats like
`7753891414`, `17753891414`, or `+1 (775) 389-1414` all work.

Every successful promotion is written to `AdminAccessLog` with
`action = 'grant_admin'` for auditing.

### Audit trail

Every admin action creates an `AdminAccessLog` entry recording:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `adminId` | The admin who performed the action |
| `targetId` | The user whose account was affected |
| `action` | `view_account` or `grant_admin` |
| `notes` | Free-text details (e.g. who initiated the promotion) |
| `createdAt` | Timestamp |

This provides a complete audit trail of admin account access for security
and compliance review.

### Schema additions

| Model | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `AdminAccessLog` | Audit trail for admin access to user accounts |

- Click **"View →"** next to any user to open their detail page.
